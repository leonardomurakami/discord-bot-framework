## üéØ **Priority Order for Next Development Session**

### **High Priority (Should be done next)**
1. **Backend Integration & Testing** - Ensure core functionality works
2. **Real-time Features Enhancement** - Complete the interactive experience
3. **User Experience Improvements** - Polish the interface

### **Medium Priority**
4. **Mobile & Accessibility** - Ensure broad device support
5. **Performance & Scalability** - Optimize for production use
6. **Integration Testing** - Validate multi-user scenarios

### **Lower Priority (Future enhancements)**
7. **Advanced Music Features** - Add nice-to-have functionality
8. **Documentation & Deployment** - Prepare for production
9. **Security & Validation** - Harden for public deployment
10. **Advanced Integration** - Extend with third-party services

## üìù **Implementation Notes**

### **Technical Considerations**
- All new features should integrate with existing permission system
- Maintain backward compatibility with Discord bot commands
- Use existing database models where possible
- Follow established code patterns and conventions

### **Testing Strategy**
- Unit tests for all new API endpoints
- Integration tests for database operations
- End-to-end tests for critical user flows
- Performance tests for queue operations

### **Deployment Requirements**
- Lavalink server properly configured
- Redis for session management (optional but recommended)
- Database migrations for any new fields
- Environment variables documented
