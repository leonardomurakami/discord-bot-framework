## Best Practices

### For Moderators

- Monitor message purging to avoid removing important information
- Use slowmode proactively during heated discussions

### For Administrators
- Set up proper role hierarchy to prevent permission abuse

- Train moderators on proper command usage
- Consider implementing warning systems for minor infractions

## Technical Notes
